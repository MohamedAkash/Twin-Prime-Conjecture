# Twin-Prime-Conjecture

This repository contains the final project for a Discrete Mathematics course, focusing on the Twin Prime Conjecture.

## Project Description

The Twin Prime Conjecture explores whether there are infinitely many twin prime pairs. Twin primes are pairs of prime numbers that have a difference of two, such as (11, 13) or (17, 19).

## Documentation
